# Segmentation of Bone Marrow Mesenchymal Stem Cell (MSC) Bright-Field Phase Contrast Images

This is the repository containg code, references and scripts for the
preprocessing and analysis of images of stem cells. The goal is to detect the
nuclei of Mesenchymal Stem Cells coming from the Bone Marrow of a human patient,
in order to subsequently track their positions and trace their lineages.

Images are taken using a Bright-Field Microscopy technique known as Phase
Contrast Microscopy, often used in experiments for qualitative analysis of
biological samples. The advantage of using this type of microscopy is that it
does not depend on the use of fluorescent staining agents, hence avoiding
phototoxic effects on the sample. The analysis and segmentation of the images
though is not trivial at all.
